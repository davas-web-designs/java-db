# JAVA DB
## Steps to build a db application:

1. Stablish connection with db
2. Create an Statement object
3. Execute SQL query
4. Get and read the results of the query

It was quite complicated to get this thing running specially when considering that I am not useing an ide or something of a kind, just "plain console" as I read somewhere...I say it because in order to get this running it is necesary a JDBC driver that was also a mess to get working in my os. But other than these configuration details..xD...the code is pretty easy so lets see where can we get.
